# 5G-SA-Network-with-Open5gs-and-srsRAN
In the current era of mobile communications, the demand for faster, reliable, and efficient connectivity has led to the development of fifth-generation (5G) networks.
The successful implementation of 5G networks requires an innovative and flexible approach that maximizes the use of emerging technologies. In this context, the 
combination of open-source software and technologies such as srsRAN, ZMQ, and Open5GS emerges as a promising option.

This problem is of utmost importance due to the growing demand for mobile services and applications that require high connection speeds and low latency. Implementing 
a 5G network on a single PC using srsRAN, ZMQ, and Open5GS has the potential to provide a more cost-effective and flexible solution compared to traditional physical 
infrastructure.

This study builds upon previous work in the field by leveraging open-source technologies like srsRAN, ZMQ, and Open5GS, which have been widely researched and utilized
in communication network environments. However, this study differs by specifically focusing on the implementation of a 5G network on a single PC and evaluating its 
performance. Additionally, it seeks to explore the capabilities of these technologies in a virtualized environment, offering advantages in terms of flexibility, 
scalability, and cost reduction.

The primary hypotheses of this study are that implementing a 5G network using srsRAN, ZMQ, and Open5GS on a single PC will be feasible and enable efficient 
communication. The primary objectives are to evaluate the performance of the implemented network in terms of bandwidth, latency, and concurrent user handling 
capacity. Secondary objectives include analyzing the scalability and flexibility of the solution, as well as its feasibility in terms of costs and resources.

This study is based on the theory of communication networks and 5G technologies. The hypotheses relate to the research design by proposing the implementation of a 5G 
network using srsRAN, ZMQ, and Open5GS as the independent variable, and the network's performance in terms of bandwidth, latency, and concurrent user handling as the 
dependent variables. The research design will focus on evaluating and measuring these variables to test the proposed hypotheses.

The theoretical implications of this study lie in the validation and evaluation of implementing a 5G network using open-source technologies in a virtualized
environment. This will provide additional information and insights into the performance and feasibility of this solution compared to traditional approaches to 5G 
network implementation. In practical terms, the results of this study may have significant implications in the mobile communications industry by offering a more 
flexible, scalable, and cost-effective alternative for deploying 5G networks."
